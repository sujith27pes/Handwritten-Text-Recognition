# Handwritten Text OCR using Deep Learning

This project is aimed at developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system specifically designed to recognize handwritten text using deep learning techniques. The model is implemented using Tensorflow and Keras.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a robust OCR system that can accurately recognize handwritten text from various sources.

## Features

- Built a deep learning model using Tensorflow and Keras.
- Trained the model on the IAM dataset for 50 epochs.
- Demonstrated the functionality of the model with sample inputs.

## What's Done

1. *Model Building and Training:*
   - Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using Tensorflow and Keras.
   - Trained the model with 50 epochs on the IAM dataset, which includes handwritten text samples.

2. *Demonstration:*
   - Showcased the model's performance with sample inputs, demonstrating its ability to recognize handwritten text.

## To-Dos

1. *Increase Accuracy:*
   - Implement techniques to improve the model's accuracy for better performance across all instances.
   - Experiment with hyperparameters and data augmentation.

2. *Enhance Flexibility:*
   - Modify the model to handle different font styles, sizes, and variations in handwriting.
   - Explore transfer learning or ensemble methods for better generalization.

3. *Future Scope:*
   - Add preprocessing steps using NLP/GenAI to refine the model's output and reduce errors.
   - Train the model to recognize languages of various scripts, such as Indian languages.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (Tensorflow, Keras, etc.).
3. Run the model on your input data or use the provided demonstration scripts.
